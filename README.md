This project is still very new and I'm making new decisions everyday as to where I should drive this project.

I'm using libevdev which technically makes swhkd display protocol indepdent, but we'll need to put that to the test before claiming anything.

Currently I have only been able to achieve the grabbing of input evdev, I don't know how I will process chains of keybinds, but we'll get to that later.


# Python:
Adressing the elephant in the room, Python. Python is good enough for the prototype stage of the project. 
Rust rewrite is currently in the rust-rewrite branch.
