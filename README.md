This project is still very new and I'm making new decisions everyday as to where I should drive this project.
I'm using libevdev which makes swhkd display protocol indepdent, but we'll keep the current name because I'm too lazy to find a new name.

Config file parsing doesn't exist yet, but that should change with 1.0.0 version release.

# Python:
Adressing the elephant in the room, Python. It is good enough for the prototype stage of the project. 
Rust rewrite is currently in the rust-rewrite branch.
